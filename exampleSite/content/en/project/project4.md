# Project 2 – Alternative 1 - A local development environment using Kubernetes and JupyterHub

This project provides a detailed overview of implementing a local development environment using Kubernetes and JupyterHub, aimed at enhancing collaboration and efficiency in data science projects. 

## Key Sections of the Project

### 1. Introduction
The report emphasizes the importance of efficient collaboration in data science projects and introduces Kubernetes as a powerful platform for deploying applications like JupyterHub. It outlines the goal of creating a secure and collaborative environment for multiple users to work on data science tasks without administrative overhead.

### 2. Workflow Design
The deployment workflow consists of two main steps:
- Infrastructure Level: Deploying Kubespray and mounting NFS volumes on each node, primarily executed on the master node.
- Application Level: Deploying Project 2 and its components, including Prometheus, Grafana, EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana), K10 (Kasten backup solution), and the NFS provisioner app. A Kanban board is utilized to manage work-in-progress tasks and facilitate collaboration among team members.

### 3. Technical Architecture
The architecture integrates various components within a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring efficient resource utilization. The document notes that the master/control plane is not tainted to maintain significant resources for running the Elastic Stack, and the system operates at approximately 50% utilization.

### 4. Monitoring and Backup
The system employs Prometheus for monitoring Kubernetes logs and metrics, which are visualized using Grafana. The EFK stack is integrated to scrape logs from the Kubernetes cluster, while K10 provides backup and disaster recovery solutions. The choice of FluentD over Logstash is highlighted due to its lower resource consumption.

### 5. User Management and RBAC
The document discusses the management of JupyterHub users, detailing the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure secure user authentication and authorization. This allows for the creation and removal of users while maintaining control over their access levels.

### 6. Deployment and Testing
Instructions for deploying the various components of the project are provided, along with testing procedures to ensure functionality. The document emphasizes the importance of optimizing resource usage, particularly in cloud environments, and suggests exploring namespace restrictions for CPU and RAM.

### 7. Critical Reflection and Conclusion
The report concludes with reflections on the project’s implementation, discussing challenges faced and lessons learned. It underscores the potential of Kubernetes and JupyterHub in driving innovation and collaboration in data science.

### 8. Appendices and References
The document includes appendices for additional details and a reference section for further reading.

Overall, the report serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up a local development environment using Kubernetes and JupyterHub, focusing on collaboration, monitoring, and efficient resource management.
