# Python Typing Tester Project

## Introduction
The Python typing tester project aims to develop an interactive application that helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It is designed to cater to various users, including students and professionals, by providing a fun and educational typing experience.

## Project Objectives
- To create a typing test program that allows users to measure their typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- To provide a variety of text samples for users to practice typing.
- To visually indicate typing errors and provide feedback on performance.
- To allow customization of difficulty levels and font sizes for a personalized experience.

## Key Features
### User Interaction
- Users can select their preferred font size upon initialization, with a default setting of 15 if canceled.
- Difficulty levels can be adjusted, allowing users to choose specific sentences to type.

### Game Mechanics
- The program tracks WPM and accuracy, displaying results at the end of each session.
- Incorrect words are highlighted in red, helping users identify mistakes easily.

### Data Management
- Game history is temporarily stored in lists, resetting upon program reinitialization.
- Users can view their WPM history and average metrics through graphical representations.

### User Feedback
- Results are color-coded: green for meeting or exceeding 30 WPM and 70% accuracy, red for failing to meet these benchmarks.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- The GUI includes text entry widgets, result labels, and buttons for resetting display size and viewing statistics.
- Clear distinctions are made between different sections of the interface for ease of use.

## Implementation
The project is implemented using Python, with a focus on creating a user-friendly interface and efficient coding practices. The program is designed to be versatile, accommodating various screen sizes and user preferences.
