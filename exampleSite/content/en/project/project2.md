# Ruby Acorn Project

The Ruby Acorn project focuses on developing an auto-scaling solution for a gaming service using AI predictive scaling. The project aims to optimize resource allocation based on player demand, ensuring efficient performance during peak usage times.

## Key Components of the Project

### 1. Introduction and Related Works
The project begins by discussing the need for scalable cloud solutions, referencing existing services from providers like Microsoft and Amazon. It highlights similar challenges faced by other organizations and their successful implementations of auto-scaling solutions.

### 2. Design Chapter
This section outlines the architectural framework for the auto-scaling system, incorporating AI to predict the number of virtual machines needed based on player activity. It emphasizes the importance of testing and evaluation results in shaping the design.

### 3. Solution and Architecture
The project details the implementation of a prototype that includes various scripts for managing server loads, monitoring performance, and ensuring seamless operation. It also discusses the importance of early error detection and system viability.

### 4. Pilot Implementation
This part describes the practical steps taken to deploy the solution, including generating SSH keys, setting up OpenStack instances, and configuring monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

### 5. Analysis and Results
The project evaluates the effectiveness of the predictive scaling solution, reporting a high accuracy rating of 97%. It discusses the challenges of predicting player behavior and the overall success of the auto-scaling system.

The project was only able to accomplish the reactive scaling part. However, it is a working project and constitutes a robust system that reactively scales the number of servers needed at any given time.
